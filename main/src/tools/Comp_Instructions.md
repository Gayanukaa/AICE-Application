# Program Comparison

This document outlines how to display and compare university programs based on defined comparison criteria.


## Program Comparison Details

For each university program, present information using the format below:
## Name of University-Name of course
- **Comparison Criteria_1**: content
- **Comparison Criteria_2**: content

### Example:
## Imperial College London: Computing (BEng)
- **Tuition Fees (Domestic)**: $20,000  
- **Tuition Fees (International)**: $50,000  
- **Course Structure**:  
  - *Year 1*: Programming, Discrete Mathematics, Computer Systems  
  - *Year 2*: Algorithms, Databases, Software Engineering  
  - *Year 3*: AI, Machine Learning, Final Project  
- **Entry Requirements**: A-levels (AAA) or equivalent  
- **Program Duration**: 3 years  
- **Location**: London, UK  
- **Accreditation**: ABET  


Repeat this structure for each university and program being compared.

## Final Table Comparing the Courses

The table below compares the programs using the selected criteria. Each **column** is a combination of **university name and program**, and each **row** corresponds to a specific comparison criterion.

### Example Format:

| Comparison Criteria     | University A – CS | University B – SE | University C – AI |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tuition Fee (USD)       | $20,000           | $18,500           | $22,000           |
| Program Duration (years)| 3                 | 4                 | 3                 |
| Entry Requirements      | A-levels (BBB)    | IB (32 points)    | A-levels (AAA)    |
| Location                | New York, USA     | Toronto, Canada   | Sydney, Australia |
| Accreditation Status    | ABET              | CEAB              | TEQSA             |


## Summary

Provide a brief analysis summarizing the most relevant findings from the table.

**Example Summary:**

> **Summary:** University B offers the lowest tuition fee at $18,500 per year but has the longest program duration (4 years). University C has the highest entry requirement (A-levels AAA) and is the most expensive. University A offers a balanced option in terms of cost, duration, and entry difficulty.
